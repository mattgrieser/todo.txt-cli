E17 is the latest version from the Enlightenment project, it's a desktop shell and unlike other windows managers such as Gnome, KDE, and Xfce, it doesn't use a "normal" image as background instead it uses an EDJE file so it doesn't support "real" transparency (at least in the current version). Using conky on e17 can be somehow frustrating.

Fortunately you still can display your todo.txt list although you'll need the execwatch module:

The first step is enabling the module, now you can go to the gadget menu and select it, you'll see an icon like this:

The configuration is very simple, after setting it, you can put it away, and you'll have your status ready.
