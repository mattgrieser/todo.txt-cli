# TODO.TXT Command Line Interface

If you’ve got a file called `todo.txt` on your computer right now, you’re in the right place. Countless software applications and websites can manage your to-do list with all sorts of bells and whistles. But if you don’t want to depend on someone else’s data format or on someone else’s server, a plain text file is the way to go.

Problem is, you don’t want to launch a full-blown text editor every time you need to add an item to your to-do list or mark one that’s already there as complete. With a simple but powerful shell script called `todo.sh`, you can interact with `todo.txt` at the command line for quick and easy, Unix-y access.
